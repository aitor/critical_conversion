  <h2>Spells</h2>
  <div class="spell">
    <h3>Fireball</h3>
    <p>3rd-level evocation</p>
    <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
    <p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
    <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
    <p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within a 5–7 feet range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
    <p>The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
    <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

    <p>Evocation cantrip</p>

    <p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
    <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
    <p>A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
    <p>The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
